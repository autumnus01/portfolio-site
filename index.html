                Hi, my name is Autumn! I am a freelance web developer currently studying for a major in Computer Science at University of South Carolina Aiken. I have been fascinated by computer programming and coding for as long as I can remember. My first introduction to programming came with Visual Basic in elementary school, creating small, often nonsensical or useless applications, and over the course of grade school I experimented with Python, HTML, and CSS, additionally studying JavaScript and Java in college. Eventually, feeling captivated by the endless creative possibilities of the web, I decided to commit to web development. I currently specialize in frontend but am constantly seeking to expand my skillset and aim to transition to full-stack web development as a long-term goal. 

                In my free time, I like to go on long walks in nature, produce electronic music, and read articles about philosophy and spirituality. I am also an avid music nerd and am constantly seeking to expand my horizons and discover new music.
